# Additional Notes
Our project didn't get completed in time. However, we believe the foundation behind the main classes is functioning correctly based on our JUnit testing. The parts of the project that didn't get completed are testing the functionality of the CreateBTree class and the database implementation. While we didn't get the project done, we want to draw attention to the fact that we were working for hours each week in the Lab and consistently going to tutoring sessions to try to understand and complete as much of the project as we could. Proof of this is visible in our GitHub Insights page, first in the number of commits done each week (with a daily breakdown, seen here: https://github.com/ConnorEspino/CS321-003-f21-team-09/graphs/commit-activity) as well as our individual contributions. Finally, while the project remains incomplete, we believe we've gained a much deeper understanding of not only the BTree data structure, but also a Scrum development process alongside the continued growth of our Java development skills.
