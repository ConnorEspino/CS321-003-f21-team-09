# **Please Note**
Some team members have many more issues than others, and some team members show no issues for a certain sprint. 
However, that does not necessarily mean they did nothing for that week, or that more work was done by others. 
Some team mates were working on the same open issues for multiple weeks and while the issues don't show that, 
following the commits will. I highly recommend using this project log as a guide to understanding the summaries 
from each student each week and then using a resource like the insights page on GitHub for a proper understanding 
of the work distribution.

**Jacob Swierstra:**
This week I wrote down all of the pseudo code from the book into the 
B Tree class and Tree Object class. This was All I did as it took 
me a long time to break down all of the pseudo code.
I later realized that I had written down the pseudo code for BST 
and not BTree. This was a big pain because I thought I was done with 
the whole BTree but when I realized there was nothing that kept track 
of the degree I realized something was wrong. This week I re-wrote the 
Tree Object and Btree class as well as reviewed other classes.

**Ken Reiner:**
Copied the DNA class code over from the assignment instructions into 
the file system. After that, the DNASequence class was added, with an 
array based implementation being used. While all that was happening, 
pull requests and other general duties were also being worked on.

# Sprint 2

**Connor Espino:**
Took over the BTreeObject class so that I could finish it and work on
BTreeNode. Both classes are very closely related so working on both
was good for a proper understanding of how they worked.

**Jacob Swierstra:**
I did not get much done this week. As I was home for break I spent a 
lot of time with my family and doing a lot of work around the house. 
I believe the only thing that I got done was trying to review the BTree 
class and figure out what I need to change for each class.

https://github.com/ConnorEspino/CS321-003-f21-team-09/issues/44

**Ken Reiner:**
Complete overhaul of the DNASequence class, with the proper sequence 
based implementation. The equals method had to be completely reworked, 
with an int return system rather than the basic true or false returns. 
Was not able to look at as many pull requests due to week two happening 
during Thanksgiving break.

# Sprint 3

**Connor Espino:**
Worked on the GeneBankSearchBTree class which took me down a rabbit
hole of writing the readDisk and writeDisk methods as well as some
other general fixes and changes to earlier classes and methods I had
worked on.

**Jacob Swierstra:**
This week I started on the CreateBTree class. This class was 
fairly simple although I realized I needed to pass in a lot more 
arguments to the BTree class. I also spent so much time trying to 
figure out the split child class. There still are some bug within 
the BTree folder but they are so small it is very difficult to 
figure out where and what is going wrong.

**Ken Reiner:**
Fixing broken methods within the DNASequence class, and updating 
methods that were giving the wrong output. Began work on the 
GeneBankSearchDatabase class with the class declaration and args 
arguments.

# Sprint 4

**Connor Espino:**
Completed the GeneBankFileReader class from fixes that I hadn't
realized I needed earlier. Fixed and wrote toString methods for other
classes. Made changes to GeneBankSearchBTree class and worked on
SequenceUtils class so that it passes any tests on it.

**Jacob Swierstra:**
This week we got an extension for our project which is very good. 
I worked a lot on the BTree Node and Btree class this week trying to 
get everything to run correctly. There was so much more that goes into 
the BTree Node and BTree class than I originally thought. This turned 
out to be a lot of work trying to make sure each method had the right 
input and output as well as writing to the file when needed. So much 
time was spent just trying to debug methods in the BTreeNode class. 
I don't think we are going to finish but I do think I have a better 
understanding about how a BTree works

**Ken Reiner:**
Continued working on the DNASequence class, mostly looking into the 
proper implementation of the SQLite aspect of the class. Also was able 
to review and merge pull requests from the other team members.
